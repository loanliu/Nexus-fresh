LEAN AGENT MODE

Objective: <one sentence>

Hard limits (do not exceed):
- Max tool steps: 3 (Plan -> Edit 1 file -> Show diff). No terminal runs.
- Max files to read: 3 (only from the list below). Do NOT scan whole repo.
- Max total changes: 40 lines. No refactors outside scope.

Files you MAY touch: <whitelist paths here>

Process:
1) PLAN (≤120 tokens): list the single-file edit you’ll make and why.
2) EDIT: apply ONLY that change. Keep changes minimal/isolated.
3) SHOW DIFF: present the unified diff and STOP.

If constraints block success, STOP and ask for exactly what extra file/permission you need (1 sentence).
