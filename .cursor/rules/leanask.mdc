Rules:
- Use ONLY the files I’ve pinned or explicitly mention below.
- Do NOT scan the repo, index, or open more files unless I say so.
- Keep the answer under 250 tokens. Use bullets.
- If you need more context, ask me to pin or paste the exact file/lines.
Deliverable:
- 3–5 bullet answers OR a minimal code diff (≤20 lines).
- If more work is needed, stop and list next steps.
